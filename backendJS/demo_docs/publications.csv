    On September 5, 1996, Hurricane Fran made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina. Coastal areas experienced significant erosion and scour. Erosion caused by Hurricane Fran was exacerbated by the previous dune erosion caused by Hurricane Bertha, which made landfall in the same area only two months earlier. The MAT observed very little damage in some areas, where velocity flows, wave action, and severe erosion occurred. The successful performance of buildings in these areas demonstrates the value of compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requirements.

It describes two laboratory testing protocols that determine fragility functions for various building systems and components. The first protocol, Quasi-Static Cyclic Testing of Structural and Nonstructural Components and Systems, can be used to test elements whose behavior is sensitive to the relative motion of several floors or vertical connections within a building. The second protocol, Shake Table Testing of Structural and Nonstructural Components and Systems, is designed for testing elements that are sensitive to the dynamic effects of motion imparted at a single point of attachment. Although these protocols are intended as interim methods that will be finalized over time as they are used and evaluated by researchers nationwide, they are nevertheless a significant step forward in the development of performance-based seismic design.","Download File","FEMA 461, Interim Testing Protocols for Determining the Seismic Performance Characteristics of Structural and Nonstructural Components

"FEMA P-2139: Short-Period Building Collapse Performance and Recommendations for Improving Seismic Design","Recent analytical studies investigating a wide range of modern seismic-force-resisting systems have predicted collapse rates for short-period buildings that are significantly larger than those observed in earthquakes during the past 50 years. This gap between analytically predicted and historically observed collapse rates in known as the short-period building seismic performance paradox. Additionally, analytically predicted collapse rates for short-period buildings are generally larger than maximum collapse rates used in national model codes and standards to establish seismic design requirements. The FEMA P-2139 series of reports documents a multi-year investigation of the response behavior and collapse performance of different structural systems to identify causes and develop solutions for the short-period building seismic performance paradox. Studies investigated three structural systems: wood light-frame, special reinforced masonry shear wall, and steel special concentrically braced frame systems.

"FEMA P-807, Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Multi-Unit Wood-Frame Buildings With Weak First Stories","Multi-unit wood-frame buildings with a weak first story represent a significant risk in highly seismic regions of the United States because of their high potential for collapse. This collapse potential is due primarily to their soft or weak first-story walls, which have often been weakened by large numbers of openings such as garages or store front windows.  FEMA P-807 addresses seismic retrofitting of weak-story wood-frame buildings in seismically active regions of the United States, with a focus on multi-family, multi-story buildings with weak first stories, and apartment buildings with tuck-under parking. These seismic retrofitting guidelines are the first to focus solely on the weak first story and to provide just enough additional strength to protect the first floor from collapse but not so much as to drive earthquake forces into the upper stories, placing them at risk of collapse. They are also the first to take into account the strength provided by existing non-structural walls, making seismic retrofitting more affordable. An electronic tool was developed as part of the project to help apply the rules and perform the calculations described in the report.

"FEMA Roof Snowdrift Design Guide","Following a series of heavy snow and wind events in February of 2015, a FEMA team assessed four partial school building collapses in the Greater Boston area. In all four cases, the partial collapses were due to roof snowdrift loading. In two of the four cases, the FEMA team observed and documented 3-D drifts that cannot be determined when following the current ASCE 7 minimum load requirements.

This new design guide provides guidance, in the form of three design examples, for three-dimensional (3-D) roof snowdrifts. The procedures identified are consistent with the intersecting drift provisions expected in the 2022 edition of ASCE 7 and are intended to serve as best practice guidance for design professionals in the interim.","Download File","FEMA Roof Snowdrift Design Guide

While hazard maps contribute to understanding earthquakes, there is increasing recognition among policy makers, researchers and practitioners of the need to analyze and map the earthquake risk in the United States. As urban development continues in earthquake-prone regions there is growing concern about the exposure of buildings, lifelines (e.g., utilities and transportation systems), and people to the potential effects of destructive earthquakes.

In response to this earthquake, the Special Projects task of the National Earthquake Technical Assistance Program (NETAP) was used to fund an investigation. At the time, this event had not yet been declared a federal disaster, and disaster funds were therefore not available. Because of limitations to this funding, some issues, such as performance of lifelines or building investigations in additional areas, could not be investigated. Past earthquakes in California have resulted in significant improvements to national and local building codes. For the 2014 South Napa earthquake, work was focused on documenting the observed performance of buildings and nonstructural components in order to lead into future improvements in future building codes, and to do so within six months.

The goal of the project was to assess and document the performance of a population of buildings impacted by the earthquake and develop a series of recommendations to further improve mitigation.","Download File","Performance of Buildings and Nonstructural Components in the 2014 South Napa Earthquake (FEMA P-1024)

"Repair of Earthquake-Damaged Masonry Fireplace Chimneys (FEMA P-1024-RA1)","On August 24, 2014, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake occurred in Napa, California. In response to this earthquake, the Special Projects task of the National Earthquake Technical Assistance Program (NETAP) was used to fund an investigation. At the time, this event had not yet been declared a federal disaster, and disaster funds were therefore not available. Because of limitations to this funding, some issues, such as performance of lifelines or building investigations in additional areas, could not be investigated. Past earthquakes in California have resulted in significant improvements to national and local building codes. For the 2014 South Napa earthquake, work was focused on documenting the observed performance of buildings and nonstructural components in order to lead into future improvements in future building codes, and to do so within six months.

Recovery Advisory 1 (RA1) is Appendix A of the FEMA P-1024 report. RA1 recommends best practices for reconstruction of earthquake‐damaged masonry chimneys in one‐and two‐family dwellings to minimize risk of damage in future earthquakes.","Download File","Repair of Earthquake-Damaged Masonry Fireplace Chimneys (FEMA P-1024-RA1)

The population exposed to seismic hazard has been steadily growing, leading to a higher potential for losses from seismic events. The estimated earthquake losses per year, known as Annualized Earthquake Losses (AEL), are calculated by FEMA to be $6.1 billion per year in the United States, and 55 metropolitan areas account for 85 percent of the AEL (FEMA, 2017).

The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which was first authorized by Congress in 1977, coordinates the earthquake-related activities of the Federal Government. The goal of NEHRP is to mitigate earthquake losses in the United States through basic and directed research and implementation activities in the fields of earthquake science and engineering. Under NEHRP, FEMA is responsible for developing effective earthquake risk reduction tools and promoting their implementation, as well as supporting the development of disaster-resistant building codes and standards. FEMA's NEHRP activities are led by the FEMA Headquarters (HQ), Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, Risk Reduction Division, Building Science Branch, in strong partnership with other FEMA HQ Directorates, and in coordination with the FEMA Regions, the States, the earthquake consortia, and other public and private partners. This report describes selected FEMA NEHRP accomplishments (HQ and Regional), followed by highlights from the States and U.S. territories and organizations which received FEMA support for NEHRP activities. The accomplishments described in this report showcase how FEMA and its partners, working in collaboration, continued to make progress toward earthquake loss-reduction nationwide.

New guidance and tools, continued and expanded support by FEMA Regional and Headquarters staff for ShakeOut drills and the 2013 Building Safety Month, training in earthquake topics offered at the State and local level, and best practices and new and innovative projects undertaken by States and U.S. Territories and organizations.","Download File","The FEMA National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program: Accomplishments in Fiscal Year 2013

"The Importance of Building Codes in Earthquake-Prone Communities Fact Sheet","There is an often-repeated saying, “Earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do.” Although you can’t control the seismic hazard in the community where you live or work, you can influence the most important factor in saving lives and reducing losses from an earthquake: the adoption and enforcement of up-to-date building codes. Evaluating older buildings and retrofitting structural and non-structural components also are critical steps. To survive and remain resilient, communities should also strengthen their core infrastructure and critical facilities so that these can withstand an earthquake or other disaster and continue to provide essential services.","Download File","The Importance of Building Codes in Earthquake-Prone Communities Fact Sheet
